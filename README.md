# Overview
This project is a react Where's Wally app.  I hooked this project up to firebase's firestore to keep track of the scores so that I only have the best scores out of all the attempts.  This was a challenging project, but I was satisfied with how it ended.  The levels were set at a fixed with so it is not currently responsive and on screens too large it does leave some blank space which I am aware of.
